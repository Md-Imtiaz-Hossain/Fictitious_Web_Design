# Fictitious_Web_Design

Full Description at a glance: 

This assignment tasks you with creating a website using Mobile-First Responsive Web Design. It's an individual project,
and you'll be simulating a web design company. The website should have several pages, including a home page, founders
page, news page, canvas demo page, contact page, accessibility page, legal and security page, design page, and testing
page.

For the Home Page, you're required to showcase your company's virtues, create a fictitious logo, and demonstrate your
ability to create an attractive and fast-loading page.

The Founders Page should include details and images of three fictitious founders, allowing you to showcase your skills
in layout and presentation.

The News Page involves creating at least three fictitious news items with accompanying images. These news items should
highlight positive aspects of your fictitious company, demonstrating your use of CSS for typographic effects.

The Canvas Demo Page is where you can use JavaScript. It should feature an interactive match-the-pairs game using a 4x4
grid of images. Clicking on images should reveal positive phrases about your fictitious company.

The Contact Page must include fictitious contact details and a form for users to send comments via email. Although the
form won't actually send emails, it should be visually appealing, showcasing your HTML and CSS skills.

The Accessibility Page should include your accessibility statement and the reasoning behind your choices, demonstrating
your understanding of web accessibility principles.

The Legal and Security Page requires you to address legal issues and security considerations for your website, supported
by references.

The Design Page is where you describe your Mobile-First Responsive Web Design approach, including an introduction, site
map, design mock-ups, menu system considerations, and justification for breakpoints and tweakpoints.

The Testing Page should cover optimization, debugging, browser testing, and accessibility testing, with screenshots and
explanations.

Overall, your website must be consistent in design, legible, and utilize HTML5 semantic elements. Appearance should be
controlled by stylesheets, and you should use @media queries in a structured way, reflecting a mobile-first approach.
The source code should be well-organized with appropriate comments, demonstrating your understanding of web development
principles.
