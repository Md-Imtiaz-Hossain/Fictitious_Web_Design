        <h2>Optimization</h2>
        <p>
            As part of our website development process, we have taken several
            measures to optimize page and image loading times. These include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Compressing and resizing images to reduce file size without
                compromising quality.
            </li>
            <li>
                Minifying CSS and JavaScript files to reduce their size and improve
                loading speed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Implementing caching mechanisms to store static resources and
                improve subsequent page loads.
            </li>
            <li>
                Using a content delivery network (CDN) to distribute website content
                across multiple servers and reduce latency.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We have monitored the website's performance using browser developer
            tools, such as the Network and Performance tabs, to identify areas for
            further optimization. By analyzing the waterfall charts and loading
            times, we have made necessary adjustments to enhance the overall user
            experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are examples of the website's performance before and after
            optimization:

        <h2>Debugging</h2>
        <p>
            Throughout the development process, we have utilized HTML and CSS
            validators to ensure code validity and identify any potential issues.
            The results of the validation process were as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                HTML Validator: [Number of errors/warnings] errors and [Number of
                errors/warnings] warnings found. These errors and warnings were
                addressed by fixing the corresponding code.
            </li>
            <li>
                CSS Validator: [Number of errors/warnings] errors and [Number of
                errors/warnings] warnings found. These errors and warnings were
                resolved by refining the CSS code.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            By following standard coding practices and adhering to the HTML and
            CSS specifications, we have ensured a well-structured and valid
            website.
        </p>

        <h2>Browser Testing</h2>
        <p>
            Our website has undergone extensive testing on different devices and
            browsers to ensure compatibility and consistent rendering across
            platforms. We have tested the website on the following browsers:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Chrome [Version 115.0.5790.98]</li>
            <li>Firefox [Version 115.0]</li>
            <li>Edge [Version 114.0.1823.82]</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Here are screenshots showcasing the website's appearance on different
            browsers and devices:
            <!-- Add screenshots of different browser/device tests -->
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Accessibility Testing</h2>
        <p>
            Accessibility is a key aspect of our website development process. We
            have conducted thorough accessibility testing using the WAVE (Web
            Accessibility Evaluation) tool provided by WebAIM. The tool has helped
            us identify and address accessibility issues, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Missing alternative text for images.</li>
            <li>Inadequate heading structure.</li>
            <li>Inconsistent color contrast.</li>
            <li>Keyboard navigation and focus management.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            After making the necessary improvements, we retested the website with
            WAVE to ensure compliance with accessibility standards. Here is a
            report of the tool's output and the actions taken to resolve
            identified issues:
            <!-- Include the WAVE tool report and explain the fixes made -->
